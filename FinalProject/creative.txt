Creative Feature: Training PokémonFor my creative addition, I added a way for trainers to train their Pokémon. I made a new endpoint called /train. When a trainer sends in their team ID and a Pokémon ID, it gives that Pokémon a random strength boost between 0 and 10. This simulates the idea of training to make their Pokémon stronger.To do this, I updated the database to add a new column called "strength" to the membership table. This way, strength is tracked separately for each Pokémon on each team. That made the most sense because the same Pokémon could be on different teams and trained differently.I also added logging so that every time a Pokémon gets trained, it shows up in the log file.I thought this would be a fun way to make battles more interesting. If I had more time, I would also update the battle system to use strength in the calculation, so trained Pokémon give their teams an advantage.This was a fun way to expand the project and give it a little more personality!
